v0.20.4
26/04/2017 @ 11:21

- Minor bugfix in slice position and ACR spreadsheet. No
  effect on results.

============================================================

v0.20.3
25/04/2017 @ 16:47

- Includes an Excel spreadsheet in /docs for ACR analysis
- Several formatting changes to outputs to match new ACR
  spreadsheet

============================================================

v0.20.2
20/04/2017 @ 15:56

- Added a try/except to catch images without PixelBandwidth in
  the DICOM header.
- When no PixelBandwidth is detected, MIPPY takes a value of
  -1 for both pixel bandwidth and image bandwidth. This should
  prevent errors/exceptions in most cases, but still make it
  obvious that it's not a true value.

============================================================

v0.20.1
20/04/2017 @ 14:00

- Added automatic JPEG decompression for compressed DICOM
  files. Uses DCMTK's dcmdjpeg, with compiled binaries for
  Windows, Linux and Mac in MIPPY/lib directory.

============================================================

v0.19.1
19/04/2017 @ 10:25

- Changed all ACR/QA modules to automatically detect phantom
  geometry and removed phantom/orientation options
- Changed ACR slice profile to use longer profiles (at 
  request of AC)
- Added subpixel=False option to find_phantom_geometry
- Changed ACR uniformity to allow elliptical ROI to match
  non-circular phantoms

============================================================

v0.18.4
18/04/2017 @ 16:36

- Edited resolution results output to give white/black
  values and all profiles. Also identifies which colour
  profiles correspond to which result.

============================================================

  led to inflated pixel values
