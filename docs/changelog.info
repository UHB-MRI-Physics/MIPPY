============================================================

v0.21.12
04/10/2017 @ 09:39

- Bugfixing again. Wasn’t running chmod due to error in
  logic!

============================================================

v0.21.11
03/10/2017 @ 23:12

- Bugfix - missing underscore in dcmdjpeg_copy in
  application.py

============================================================

v0.21.10 (including 0.21.8 and 0.21.9)
03/10/2017 @ 19:20

- Corrected bugs in os.chmod() for dcmdjpeg copy in temp
  folders. Moved outside of "executable" check because
  check never failed.

============================================================

v0.21.7
03/10/2017 @ 15:04

- Added use_masks switch in order to ignore mask process in
  some instances of MIPPYCanvas. Avoids performance hit when
  using a large number of small ROIs.

============================================================

v0.21.6
03/10/2017 @ 14:47

- At startup, MIPPY now creates a temp copy of dcmdjpeg and
  sets executable permissions.

============================================================

v0.21.5
03/10/2017 @ 11:21

- Reworked logging to use default python logging module
  wrapped with mippy.mlogging.

============================================================

v0.21.4
02/10/2017 @ 09:46

- Added chmod step to MIPPY startup to check status of
  dcmdjpeg and, if necessary, add permission to execute

============================================================

v0.21.3
28/09/2017 @ 11:05

- Made dcmdjpeg_mac executable

============================================================

v0.21.2
28/09/2017 @ 10:33

- Fixed multiple bugs relating to enhanced MR images in
  files application.py and mdicom.mrenhanced.py

============================================================

v0.21.1
28/09/2017 @ 08:29

- Corrected bug where it didn't find image viewer if no
  default modules folder.
- Changed ROI functions in MIPPYCanvas to create (and
  update) masks for all active ROIs, speeding up pixel
  retrieval and stats calculation.

============================================================

v0.21.0
27/09/2017 @ 15:46

- ACR modules moved to separate project.
- Complete overhaul of MIPPY's structure. Details in
  full MIPPY documentation.
- "setup.py" file created for generating wheel of the
  mippy module to be installed in python directory.

============================================================

v0.20.5
04/05/2017 @ 11:30

- Changed default phantom area to 70% for ACR SNR and
  uniformity

============================================================

v0.20.4
26/04/2017 @ 11:21

- Minor bugfix in slice position and ACR spreadsheet. No
  effect on results.

============================================================

v0.20.3
25/04/2017 @ 16:47

- Includes an Excel spreadsheet in /docs for ACR analysis
- Several formatting changes to outputs to match new ACR
  spreadsheet

============================================================

v0.20.2
20/04/2017 @ 15:56

- Added a try/except to catch images without PixelBandwidth in
  the DICOM header.
- When no PixelBandwidth is detected, MIPPY takes a value of
  -1 for both pixel bandwidth and image bandwidth. This should
  prevent errors/exceptions in most cases, but still make it
  obvious that it's not a true value.

============================================================

v0.20.1
20/04/2017 @ 14:00

- Added automatic JPEG decompression for compressed DICOM
  files. Uses DCMTK's dcmdjpeg, with compiled binaries for
  Windows, Linux and Mac in MIPPY/lib directory.

============================================================

v0.19.1
19/04/2017 @ 10:25

- Changed all ACR/QA modules to automatically detect phantom
  geometry and removed phantom/orientation options
- Changed ACR slice profile to use longer profiles (at 
  request of AC)
- Added subpixel=False option to find_phantom_geometry
- Changed ACR uniformity to allow elliptical ROI to match
  non-circular phantoms

============================================================

v0.18.4
18/04/2017 @ 16:36

- Edited resolution results output to give white/black
  values and all profiles. Also identifies which colour
  profiles correspond to which result.

============================================================

v0.18.3
18/04/2017 @ 15:48

- Added issue reporting tool to Help menu

============================================================

v0.18.2
18/04/2017 @ 14:09

- Added ability to view this changelog file from within
  MIPPY
- Moved changelog and version info into 'docs'

============================================================

v0.18.1
18/04/2017 @ 13:57

- Reworked ACR distortion module to use central grid point 
  as origin for radial profiles
- Corrected bug in profile smoothing for ACR distortion which 
  led to inflated pixel values
