# MIPPY: Modular Image Processing in Python

## Introduction

MIPPY is a framework written in Python (2.7) to organise, read, view and analyse DICOM format images. It was written primarily for analysis of MRI quality assurance data, but can be (and has been) extended to other analysis techniques such as T1 mapping and ASL data analysis. It is free to download and install, and was created by the MRI physics team at University Hospital Birmingham, UK.

## Usage

After starting MIPPY, use the FILE menu to open the directory containing your images. MIPPY will read the directory and organise images by patient, study and series. From here you can select which images you are interested in, and load modules such as "Image Viewer" and "Image Uniformity Analysis".

## Contributing

Contributors and developers are welcomed with open arms! However, given the infant stage of this project, we ask that would-be developers get in touch so we can add you to the project and keep a handle on who's doing what.  The developers can be contacted via email - rbf906@gitlab.com

## Installation

### Requirements

MIPPY relies on a number of external python packages, but these should all be available via PyPI and install automatically when running the setup script. Any issues with installation, please get in touch.

### Installation

To install, head to the following link:
https://gitlab.com/rbf906/mippy/repository/archive.zip?ref=master

(On Windows) Unpack the zip file into where you want the program to live and run the "install_mippy" file.  This should download all the necessary packages.  You should then be able to run "MIPPY.pyw" to start the program.

### Configuration

There should be no further configuration required after installation.
